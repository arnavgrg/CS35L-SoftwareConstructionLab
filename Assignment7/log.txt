Setup my beagleone by following the instructions:
https://piazza.com/class/jfinlsjb34f3vc?cid=282

Followed steps to install openSSH from slides
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install openssh-server
sudo apt-get install openssh-client

I then created my public and private keys using:
ssh-keygen (saved it in /root/.ssh/id_rsa)
File Name: privateKey
My Identification: privateKey
My PublicKey: privateKey.pub
Key FingerPrint: 6d:7a:40:bd:3a:65:62:db:5a:7f:ca:4f:73:04:a8:69 root@beaglebone

Followed the server steps mentioned on the slides. First I read the man page for useradd.
Then I created a user for my lab partner Sid. 
sudo useradd -d /home/sid -m sid
sudo passwd sid
Enter new UNIX password: sid

Steps to allow Sid to SSH into my BeagleBone:
cd /home/sid
sudo mkdir .ssh
sudo chown -R sid .ssh
sudo chmod 700 .ssh

Used ifconfig to find the IP of the server and gave this to my partner Sid.

By this point, Sid created a user called 'arnav' on his 
BeagleBone, and also used the same steps as above to setup his server. 

Since the wifi kept refusing permission to SSH successfully,
and to get past the firewall, we decided to use a mobile hotspot. 
After swapping wifi connections to the phone, we were able to run the 
following commands successfully:

Attempting to login using password:
ping 192.168.43.20
ssh arnav@192.168.43.20
This presents two warnings, where it adds the server address to list of known hosts. 
I was able to create directories and files.

Attempting to ssh successfully without a password:
ssh-copy-id -i arnav@192.168.43.20
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)" -> done to enable ssh-agent
ssh-add -> adds private key to the ssh-agent.
ssh arnav@169.232.100.80
This works successfully and it says:
Number of key(s) added: 1
