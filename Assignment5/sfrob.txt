1. Testing sfrob with test data from Assignment 4
and Assignment 5

	Assignment 4:
	time printf '*~BO *{_CIA *hXE]D *LER #@_GZY #E\\OX #^BO #FKPS #NEM\4' | ./sfrob | od -ta

	real: 0m0.004s
	user: 0m0.001s
	sys:  0m0.003s

	Assignment 5:
	time printf '~BO {_CIA FKPS NEM' | ./sfrob | od -ta

	real: 0m0.002s
	user: 0m0.003s
	sys:  0m0.001s

	Assignment 5 (>5MB file)
	time ./sfrob < input.txt

	real: 0m17.049s
	user: 0m1.719s
	sys:  0m1.357s

2. Testing sfrobu with test data from Assignment 4
and Assignment 5 

	Assignment 4:
	time printf '*~BO *{_CIA *hXE]D *LER #@_GZY #E\\OX #^BO #FKPS #NEM\4' | ./sfrobu | od -ta

	real: 0m0.003s
	user: 0m0.002s
	sys:  0m0.003s

	Assignment 5:
	time printf '~BO {_CIA FKPS NEM' | ./sfrobu | od -ta

	real: 0m0.004s
	user: 0m0.002s
	sys:  0m0.002s

	Assignment 5 (>5MB file)
	time ./sfrobu < input.txt

	real: 0m18.214s
	user: 0m2.194s
	sys:  0m7.289s

3. Testing sfrobs

	Assignment 4:
	time printf '*~BO *{_CIA *hXE]D *LER #@_GZY #E\\OX #^BO #FKPS #NEM\4' | ./sfrobs | od -ta

	real: 0m0.011s
	user: 0m0.004s
	sys:  0m0.007s

	Assignment 5:
	time printf '~BO {_CIA FKPS NEM' | ./sfrobs | od -ta

	real: 0m0.006s
	user: 0m0.005s
	sys:  0m0.005s

	Assignment 5 (>5MB file)
	time ./sfrobs < input.txt

	real: 0m17.432s
	user: 0m0.355s
	sys:  0m0.725s

The time taken for small transliterations for both sfrob and sfrobu are both negligible and make it hard to compare.
This hints that for small file sizes, there is no significant
different in time.
However, there is a clear difference in the time taken by the system to run input.txt
sfrob has fewer system calls, and takes significantly lesser time
from the system calls perspective in comparison to sfrobu.
Therefore, for larger file sizes, unbuffered is realtively not as optimal.
sfrobs is much faster with larger files and has fewer system calls indicated by the shortest time for system calls 
This indicates that shell scripts are more efficient.
